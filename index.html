                    <p>We are a part of a generation, where we fly to Mars in search of water, dreaming of new colonisation, A part of era where companies like SoftBank invest heavily on  creepy robotics research company like Boston dynamics and where AI drives our car, safely taking us point 
                   A to B. I can go on and on but let's get to the point on why coding is essential. 
                   <br>
                    For aspiring “Tech Entrepreneur” like me and many you, it is inevitable to learn and understand the language of software to build our product. Most importantly because it demands you to think, solve problems and is the traits of any entrepreneurs. An entrepreneur is someone i personally believe, who knows in and out about his product, there is no way around it.
                   There is no way you somehow had manage to create a tech-backed company, lets assume like an  online delivery app and outsource the entire app building coding part to a 3rd Party, It is more like assuming, you have a company that sells clay pots, but you have never made a pot by yourself.

                   <br>                 
                   Founder of DropBox says understanding how to code, is like having  super powers, And the irony is, most of these powers come for free and is all over the internet.
                   Future is not far away where we will have automated AI robots who does our entire housekeeping, or drones that proactively deliver our package. Just imagine what leverage we would have understanding the code behind the tech that runs such futuristic products.
                   <br>
                   Even for job seekers, CTO of <b>Averon Media</b> “Bodh Ram” says “the reason of unemployment is not solely because of lack of Jobs, but mostly because people are unemployable, <quote style="color:#0070c9">"Everybody wants the job, but nobody has the skills"</quote> he quotes.
                   I bet you, to go to any site where you can search jobs, you will most likely end up, finding most of the job openings has something to do with software development or the employer is looking for someone who understands how to work on a particular software.
                   My agenda here is not to tell you that ‘just because of higher package, pursue software development’, but for job seekers i would say if a high paying dream job is your goal, then learning about a technology, should not stop you. For which will take your job status to the next level.
